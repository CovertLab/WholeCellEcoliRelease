"Table 5. mRNA half-lives in M9 + glucose and LB media"				
				
"This table contains the half-lives for individual mRNAs in M9 + glucose"				
"and LB media. Half-lives were determined by using mRNA harvested from cultures grown"				
"at 30ÂºC to OD600 = 0.8 as described in Materials and Methods. The data in this file"				
"were used as source data for Tables 1-3 as well as Figs. 1 and 3."
