Some complexes are missing

For example, in `raw/Ecocyc_rna_protein_complexes.csv` the complex `CPLX0-3964` exists.  Sadly, it does not exist in `proteinComplexes.csv`.

However, the complex `CPLX0-3962` does exist in `raw/Ecocyc_rna_protein_complexes.csv` and in `proteinComplexes.csv`, so it's not just a careless omission.

Stoichiometry of complexes is wrong

If I use the following BioVelo query on Ecocyc:

html-sort-ascending([(Z1^?FRAME-ID, Z1^?COMPONENTS) : Z1<-ECOLI^^Protein-Complexes],1)

I see that `CPLX0-221`, for example, is made up of

RNA polymerase, core enzyme and RNA polymerase, sigma 19 factor

which have the following frame-ids:

`APORNAP-CPLX` and `PD00440`

However, in `data/Ecocyc_protein_complexes.csv` the subunits are listed as:

((PD00440, 1) (APORNAP-CPLX, 1) (EG10893-MONOMER, 2) (RPOC-MONOMER, 1) (RPOB-MONOMER, 1))

Note that `(EG10893-MONOMER, 2) (RPOC-MONOMER, 1) (RPOB-MONOMER, 1))` are the subunits of `APORNAP-CPLX`.
So the subunits are getting double-counted.
