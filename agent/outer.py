	Outer: coordinate the communication between inner agents running their individual simulations
	and the containing environmental context.

	This class represents the larger environmental context for each of the individual simulation
	agents. The general flow is that each inner agent will declare its existence to the 
	outer agent until the outer agent receives a signal from the control process to begin execution.
	Once this signal is received the outer agent will broadcast the local environmental
	concentrations to each inner agent, at which point they will perform their local calculations
	and report back with their updated local environment. Once the outer agent receives
	a message from each inner agent these changes are integrated, and the newly updated environmental
	concentrations will be sent back. This loop will continue until the outer agent receives a 
	message to shutdown, when it will send a message to each inner agent to shutdown and wait for
	acknowledgements, at which point it will shutdown itself.

	Inner agents may also be added and removed while the execution is running without interruption.

	The context environmental simulation is an instance of EnvironmentSimulation.
