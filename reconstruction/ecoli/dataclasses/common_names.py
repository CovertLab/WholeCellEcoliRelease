"""
Simulation Data common names.

This function creates dictionaries of common names of simulation elements in
sim_data, with {Object ID: (Primary Name, Synonyms)}.

The tsv files in 'reconstruction/ecoli/flat/common_names', which are used to
build the common_names dictionary, were taken from ecocyc and reformatted.
Ecocyc provided the columns 'Object ID' and 'Synonyms'; entries in
'Primary Name' were mostly taken from the first entry in synonyms, but in some
cases they were selected by hand.
