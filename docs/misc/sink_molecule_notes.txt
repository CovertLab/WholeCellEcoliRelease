I'm attempting to curate the identities and functions of "sink" molecules that are part of the Feist metabolic reconstruction, so that we can decide how to handle them in our simulation.

ID: 4HBA[c]
name: 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol
function: unknown
Feist reactions:
	product of thiazole phosphate synthesis, catalyzed by ( b2530  and  b3992  and  ( b3990  and  b3991 )  and  b0423  and  b4407 )
	)
EcoCyc reactions:
	export from cytosol to periplasm, no annotated transporter


ID: 5DRIB[c]
name: 5'-deoxyribose
function: unknown
Feist reactions:
	product of 5'-deoxyadenosine nuclosidase, catalyzed by b0159
EcoCyc reactions:
	hydrolysis of 5'-deoxyadenosine to form 5-deoxy-D-ribose and adenine (catalyzed by 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase)
	nonspecific sugar/phosphate reactions


ID: AACALD[c]
name: Aminoacetaldehyde
function: product of taurine degradation, occus when sulfur-starved
Feist reactions:
	produce of Taurine dioxygenase, catalyzed by b0368
EcoCyc reactions:
	product of taurine degradation IV (catalyzed by taurine dioxygenase)


ID: HMFURN[c]
name: 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone
function: unknown
Feist reactions:
	product of 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione cyclization (spontaneous), catalyzed by none (?)
EcoCyc reactions:
	none for E. coli; only metabolic pathways seem to be in plants


ID: OXAM[c]
name: Oxamate
function: 
Feist reactions:
	product of oxamate transcarbamoylase, catalyzed by none
EcoCyc reactions:
	allantonin degradation (IV) product (catalyzed by oxamate carbamoyltransferase, not studied in E. coli)
	formation of oxalate by loss of ammonium, no enzyme (oxalate is then used in many other pathways)
