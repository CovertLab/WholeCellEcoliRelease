Initial Conditions
==================

(1) Unify this calculation in initial conditions/fitter
	monomerExpression = normalize(
		kb.rnaExpression['expression'][kb.rnaIndexToMonomerMapping] /
		(np.log(2) / kb.cellCycleLen.asNumber(units.s) + kb.monomerData["degRate"].asNumber(1 / units.s))
		)

	nMonomers = countsFromMassAndExpression(
		monomerMass.asNumber(units.g),
		kb.monomerData["mw"].asNumber(units.g/units.mol),
		monomerExpression,
		kb.nAvogadro.asNumber(1/units.mol)
		)

(2) Break initial_conditions/fitter functions into their own separate files or groups of functions into groups of files.

DONE (3) Precompute A,T,G,C content of genome and store it in the KB

DONE (4) Change initializeBulkComponents to initializeSmallMolecules

(5) Address this comment in initial conditions: "We have to remove things with zero concentration because taking the inverse of zero isn't so nice."

(6) Comment the code for adjusting the mass fractions to account for metabolite pools.

(7) Comment the code for setting GDP pool

(8) Comment initializeComplexes code

(9) Address TODO and TOKBs in initializeTranscription and initializeTranslation

(10) Comment initializeReplication a bit

Fitter
======

DONE (1) Move fitKb, fitKb2 into their own files and rename fitKb to fitKb1

(2) Compute this early in the fitter and reuse:
		np.log(2) / kb.cellCycleLen + kb.monomerData["degRate"]

DONE (3) Break setRNACounts into separate functions per RNA type

(4) Counts from mass and expression should have its math documented. Remove units checking and let units carry through.

(5) Counts from mass and exp and normalize should be moved somewhere else - to utils in wholecell.

(6) Don't pass views or the KB object only fundamental types.

(7) Move hard coded data in fitter into hard coded constants in the KB
