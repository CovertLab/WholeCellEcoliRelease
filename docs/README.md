# Whole Cell Model of E. coli

These are the docs for a variety of topics on the Whole Cell Model.

## setup

* [Required development tools](dev-tools.md) -- installation and tips
* [Creating the "pyenv" runtime environment](create-pyenv.md)
* [Setting up to run FireWorks](wholecell/fireworks/README.md) -- needed only to run a FireWorks workflow of cell simulations and analysis plots
* [Set up Zookeeper and Kafka](../agent/README.md) -- needed only for multi-scale agents

## running

* [How to run the Whole Cell Model](run.md); actually the top level [README](../README.md) is more informative
* [How to run the Causality visualization tool](https://github.com/CovertLab/causality)
* [How to run multi-scale agents](../environment/README.md)

## development

* [Background on the model](background.md)
* [Coding style guide](style-guide.md)

## relevant papers

* [A Whole-Cell Computational Model Predicts Phenotype from Genotype](https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(12)00776-3)
