# Whole Cell Model of E. coli

These are the docs for a variety of topics on the Whole Cell Model.

## setup


There are two alternative ways to set up to run the model:

1. **Docker setup (recommended):** Install the [Docker Desktop software](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) then pull our Docker container image from the GitHub Package Registry or build it locally using the `cloud/build-containers-locally.sh` or the `cloud/build.sh` shell script.

   A Docker container image takes one `docker build` command to build and is isolated from your computer's operating system, any versions of Python, binary libraries, and everything else installed on your development computer.

   You can then run the model inside the container.
   (PyCharm should support debugging into a Docker container but we haven't tested that.)
   
   **NOTE:** Docker Desktop for Windows is not currently compatible with VirtualBox.  If you use VirtualBox, try installing the legacy [Docker Toolbox](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases) instead.  You may also need to adjust the memory allocated to the VirtualBox VM (named 'default') that gets created.  In VirtualBox, select the 'default' VM and under system, change the base memory from 1 GB to 4 GB. 

2. **pyenv setup:** Follow [Required development tools](dev-tools.md) to install the development tools including pyenv, gcc, make, and git, then follow [Creating the "pyenv" runtime environment](create-pyenv.md) to set up the Python runtime virtual environment for the model including binary libraries and Python packages.
`pyenv` virtual environments take more steps to build and depend on your computer's OS, but are lighter weight to run and easier for debugging.

   You can then run the model with this version of Python under `pyenv`.

   If you have Anaconda installed, you might have to take Anaconda off the `$PATH` temporarily to run the Whole Cell Model.

   This approach takes many careful steps that vary depending on your operating system. It will run â‰ˆ25% faster than inside a container and works with any Python debugger.
