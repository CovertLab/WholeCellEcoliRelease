\paragraph{Complexation}
\label{sec:complexation}


\subparagraph{Model implementation.}
This process models the formation of all macromolecular complexes except for the formation of 70S ribosomes from 30S and 50S subunits, which is performed by \texttt{Translation}. Macromolecular complexation is done by identifying complexation reactions that are possible (which are reactions that have sufficient counts of all sub-components), performing one randomly chosen possible reaction, and re-identifying all possible complexation reactions. This process assumes that macromolecular complexes form spontaneously, and that complexation reactions are fast and complete within the time step of the simulation. This approach is very similar to the \textit{M. genitalium} model of complexation with the exception that the selection of a complexation reaction was weighted by a multinomial distribution parameterized by substrate availability rather than a uniform distribution.  We found that the choice of distribution had no major effect on behavior of the process. Additionally, the \textit{M. genitalium} simulations describe 201 macromolecular complexes, whereas over 5 times as many are implemented in the \textit{E. coli} model.\\
