\paragraph{Energy requirements of cell maintenance}
As was the case in our \textit{M. genitalium} simulations, and in many flux balance analysis models, not all of the energy consumed by metabolic pathways, macromolecular polymerization, or other growth and non-growth associated processes is accounted for explicitly in our \emph{E. coli} model. This is primarily due to a lack of experimental data and/or knowledge accounting for its usage.  Similar to the \textit{M. genitalium} model, we have incorporated reactions in the metabolic model with two parameters, Growth Associated Maintenance (GAM) and Non-Growth Associated Maintenance (NGAM), which modulate energy consumption associated with growth and cell maintenance.
