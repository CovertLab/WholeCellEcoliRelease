## Processes

The Processes of the \emph{E. coli} model span several major areas of cellular physiology. We have clustered the Processes into the following groups, which we present in the order listed: Central Dogma, Metabolism, and Balanced Growth. We modeled Processes using the most appropriate mathematics for their individual network topology and degree of experimental characterization. Each process is a computational representation of chemical reactions or transformations grouped by a physiological function. The actual division of reactions across processes is a modeling decision made during model construction, and the number of Processes does not reflect their complexity or scope. The inputs and outputs of each \texttt{Process} are the counts of metabolites or macromolecules and the catalytic capacity or configuration of the enzymes that catalyze the reactions in each \texttt{Process}. This section details the model implementation, computational algorithm, associated data, and relevant code for each \texttt{Process}.
