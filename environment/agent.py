	Agent: a process with the ability to send and receive messages through Kafka.

	This is a base class that handles all of the details of connecting to Kafka and the 
	initialization and configuration of a Producer (to send messages) and Consumer
	(to receive messages). 

	To subclass Agent:

	* First, a call to super must be made in the `__init__` method of the overriding class.
	  `id` is any unique string and identifies this agent with other agents in the system.
	  `kafka_config` is a configuration dictionary containing information about the kafka host,
	  topics to subscribe to and additional information. Its details are described in the
	  docstring for `__init__`.

	* Then, you can override `initialize()` to send any messages before the consumer
	  loop begins.

	* The main method to override is `receive(topic, message)`, which will be called
	  each time a message is received on any of the topics originally subscribed to.

	* Finally, on shutdown there is a call to `finalize()` where you can put anything
	  that needs to be cleaned up or any final messages to send before the process is
	  terminated.

	Additionally, a `send(topic, message)` method is provided that does not need to be
	overridden but can be used directly, which sends a message to the specified topic
	using the configured Kafka Producer.
