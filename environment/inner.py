class Inner(Agent):

	"""
	Inner: acts as an independent simulation in a larger environmental context.

	This class wraps a simulation and mediates the communication between messages
	received from the larger environmental context and the operation of the simulation.

	The interface a simulation must provide to work inside of the this class is composed
	of the following methods:

	* simulation.initialize_local_environment()
	    Perfom any setup required for tracking changes to the local environment.

	* simulation.set_local_environment(molecule_ids, concentrations)
	    Receive a set of molecule ids to track and a dictionary containing the current
	    current concentrations in the local environment.

	* simulation.time()
	    Return the current time according to the simulation.

	* simulation.run_incremental(run_until)
	    Run the simulation until the given time.

	* simulation.get_environment_change()
	    Return the accumulated changes to the local environment as calculated by the 
	    simulation during `run_incremental(run_until)`.

	* simulation.finalize()
	    Release any resources and perform any final cleanup.

	If this interface is fulfilled, the simulation can be an Agent in the larger
	environmental simulation. Each Inner Agent will be run in its own thread/process and
	communicate with the larger environmental simulation through message passing.

		message from the environment containing the following keys:

		* `molecule_ids`: ids of the molecules to track.
		* `concentrations`: a dictionary containing the updated local concentrations.
		* `run_until`: how long to run the simulation for before reporting back the new

		* `message_id`: the id of the message as provided by the environmental simulation,
		    to be returns as an acknowledgement that the message was processed along with 
		    the updated environmental changes.

		time and responds with a `SIMULATION_ENVIRONMENT` message containing the local changes
		as calculated by the simulation.
