	"""
	Outer: coordinate the communication between individual simulations and the larger
	environmental context.

	This class represents the larger environmental context for each of the individual simulation
	agents. The general flow is that each simulation will declare its existence to the 
	environment until the environment receives a signal from the control process to begin execution.
	Once this signal is received the environment will broadcast the local environmental
	concentrations to each simulation, at which point they will perform their local calculations
	and report back with their updated local environment. Once the environmental context receives
	a message from each simulation these changes are integrated, and the new updated environmental
	concentrations will be sent back. This loop will continue until the environment receives a 
	message to shutdown, when it will send a message to each simulation to shutdown and wait for
	acknowledgements, at which point it will shutdown itself.
