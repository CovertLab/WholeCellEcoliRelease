# Container image #2: wcm-code.
# This Dockerfile builds a container image with the wcEcoli whole cell model
# code, layered on the wcm-runtime container image.
#
# To build this image locally from the wcEcoli/ project root directory:
#
#     > docker build -f cloud/docker/wholecell/Dockerfile -t ${USER}-wcm-code --build-arg from=${USER}-wcm-runtime .
#
# (If you want to build container image #3 on top of the locally-built base,
# you'll have to edit that Dockerfile or upload this image.)
#
# (To build using the Cloud Build service and store in the Container Registry,
# run `cloud/build.sh`.)
#
# After building locally you can start up a new container from the image:
#
#     > docker run --name wholecelltest -it --rm ${USER}-wcm-code
#
# or if you used build.sh or build-wcm.sh to build using Cloud Build:
#
#     > PROJECT="$(gcloud config get-value core/project)"
#     > TAG="gcr.io/${PROJECT}/${USER}-wcm-code"
#     > docker run --name wholecelltest -it --rm "${TAG}"
#
# It will start a shell where you can execute commands:
#
#     # pytest
#
# If this succeeds you can start running WCM code in the container, e.g.:
#
#     # python runscripts/manual/runParca.py
