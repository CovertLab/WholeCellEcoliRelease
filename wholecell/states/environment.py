"""
External state that represents environmental molecules and conditions.

	- nutrient_data: a dictionary including the following keys and their values:
		- externalExchangeMolecules: a dictionary of all the nutrient condition names, with a list of molecules as their values.
		- importExchangeMolecules: a dictionary of all the nutrient condition names, with a list of molecules as their values.
		- importConstrainedExchangeMolecules: a dictionary of all the nutrient condition names, with a list of molecules as their values.
		- importUnconstrainedExchangeMolecules: a dictionary of all the nutrient condition names, with a list of molecules as their values.
		- secretionExchangeMolecules: a list of exchange molecules

	- nutrients_time_series: a list of tuples that include time and nutrients in which shifts occur.

	- nutrients: a string specifying the current nutrient condition.

	- times: a list of all times at which the nutrients shift.

	Functions:
	----------
	- update: updates nutrients according to nutrients_time_series
