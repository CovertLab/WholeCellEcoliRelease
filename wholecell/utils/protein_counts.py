	Get simulated counts and validation counts of monomers that exist in both
	the simulation and the validation data

	Arguments:
		validation_counts: Monomer counts from validation data.
		monomer_counts: Simulated monomer counts (from translation
			process).
		validation_ids: Monomer IDs from validation data. IDs
			must appear in same order as in validation_counts.
		simulation_ids: IDs of monomers in the same order as
			monomer_counts.

	Returns:
		The simulated counts of the monomers that appear in the
		validation data, and the validation counts of the monomers in the same
		order.
