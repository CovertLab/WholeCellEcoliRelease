	'''
	Computes the dry mass fractions and counts associated with small molecules to maintain
	concentrations consistent with targets.  (Also includes water.)

	The cell is composed of a number of 'mass fractions' i.e. DNA, RNA, protein, water, and
	the less specific "small molecules" which includes both inorganic and organic molecular species
	that form part of a cell.  While we take many of the former calculations as ground truth, we
	chose to adjust (recompute) the small molecule mass fraction according to per-molecule
	observations of small molecule concentrations (compiled from various sources).

	However, this creates a potential issue: we need the small molecule mass to compute the volume,
	and the volume in turn is used to compute the counts (and therefore masses) of the small
	molecules.  We denote the first small molecule mass as Ms, and the second as Ms'.

	The total mass of the cell, Mt, is the sum of the small and non-small molecule masses:

	Mt = Ms + Mns

	The volume of the cell V times the density of the cell rho is Mt, and therefore

	rho * V = Ms + Mns

	Ms = rho * V - Mns

	This gives us our first calculation of the small molecule mass.  For the second calculation, we
	first find the abundance of each small molecule species (count n_i) as

	n_i = V * c_i

	where c_i is the concentration of each species.  Then the mass associated with each species is

	m_i = V * w_i * c_i

	where w_i is the molecular weight of a given species,.  Finally, the total small molecule mass,
	estimated from small molecule counts, is

	Ms' = sum_i m_i = V * w^T c

	where w^T c is the dot-product between the two vectors.

	Equating Ms' and Ms, and solving for V:

	V = Mns / (rho - w^Tc)

	This allows us to compute the new volume, from which we can also compute and return all n_i and
	m_i.
