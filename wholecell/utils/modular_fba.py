class FluxBalanceAnalysis(object):
	""" FluxBalanceAnalysis

	Solver for various FBA implementations.


	Required arguments:

	- reactionStoich, a dict of strings:dicts (reactionID:reaction stoich)
		Each value in the dict is a dict of molecule ID to stoichiometry pairs

	- externalExchangedMolecules, an iterable of strings (moleculeIDs)
		Every provided ID will be set up with an exchange flux.

	- objective, a dict of strings:floats (moleculeID:objective value)
		The meaning and usage of the objective will vary depending on the
		formulation of FBA desired.


	Optional arguments (set to None for default behavior):

	- objectiveType, a string
		"standard": standard FBA objective (default)
		"flexible": flexFBA
		"pools": similar to FBA; optimizes towards desired pool concentrations

	- objectiveParameters, a dict
		Keys are specific to the FBA implementation.

	- internalExchangedMolecules, an iterable of strings (moleculeIDs)
		Every provided ID will be set up with an exchange flux.

	- reversibleReactions, a list of strings (reactionIDs for reversible reactions)

	- reactionEnzymes, a dict of strings:strings (reactionID:enzymeID)

	- reactionRates, a dict of strings:floats (reactionID:catalytic rate constant * dt)
		Used to set up the pseudo metabolites and boundary constraints needed
		for limiting reactions by enzyme counts.

	- moleculeMasses, a dict of floats (moleculeID:mass)
		Used in computing the net mass into the system.  Only needed and used
		for moleculeIDs in externalExchangedMolecules.


	Caveats:

	There is no strict type checking, despite what the above may imply.

	During initialization, an exception will be raised if a reference is made
	to an unutilized metabolite/enzyme/etc as described by the reaction
	network.
