class BulkObjectsContainer(object):
	"""
	A data structure for convenient, name-based operations on elements of a
	NumPy vector.

	The BulkObjectsContainer provides an interface to the elements of a NumPy
	vector by name.  Oftentimes in a multi-domain, multi-paradigm simulation,
	we wish to store all model variables in one place, yet will only interact
	with a subset of variables in each submodel.  This class makes it easy to
	access and modify those variable values.  For example:

	>>> names = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'] # names of some model variables
	>>> container = BulkObjectsContainer(names)
	>>> container.countIs(10, 'A') # set A to 10
	>>> container.countsInc(5) # increase the counts of everything by 5
	>>> container.counts(['D', 'C']) # access D and C, in that order

	You can also create a 'view' to interact with the data in a fixed order:

	>>> view = container.countsView(['D', 'C'])
	>>> view.countsIs([10, 15]) # set D to 10 and C to 15
	>>> view.countsDec([3, 7]) # decrease D by 3 and C by 7
	>>> view.counts() # get the counts of D and C

	If used more than once, creating a view is more efficient than operating on
	the container directly.

	You can store a BulkObjectsContainer via TableWriter or (for a single
	snapshot) more compactly via pickling.

	Parameters:
		objectNames (iterable of str):
			The names that will be used to refer to the elements of the
			underlying vector.
		dtype (a valid NumPy datatype identifier): (default: np.int64)
			The data type of the underlying array. The dtype must be a scalar,
			not a structured type (with fields) nor a subarray (with a shape).

	See also
	--------
	wholecell.containers.unique_objects_container.UniqueObjectsContainer

	Notes
	-----
	The default data type is integers because the original use case was to
	track the abundances (copy numbers) of molecules.  Likewise the methods
	refer to "counts" even though the data type can be floating-point.

	Floating-point use cases:
	- concentrations of molecules
	- mean or standard deviations of counts

	The number of elements and their order is inferred from the objectNames
	parameter.

	TODO (John): Give methods more standard names (e.g. set, get, add).
	TODO (John): Move methods and attributes from mixedCase to under_scores.
	TODO (John): Get rid of single/group distinction in methods/views, and
		instead check input types against str to decide what sort of
		output to return.
	TODO (John): Use something more generic than 'counts' to reflect the fact
		that non-integer data types are permissible.
