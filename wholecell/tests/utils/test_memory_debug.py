"""Test the memory_debug utility.

Running it this way reveals the stdout messages about TestMemoryDebugNode IDs:
	python -m wholecell.tests.utils.test_memory_debug

In any case, you should see GC messages like:
	gc: uncollectable <TestMemoryDebugNode 0x110118050>
	gc: uncollectable <TestMemoryDebugNode 0x110118090>
	gc: uncollectable <TestMemoryDebugNode 0x110118110>
	gc: uncollectable <dict 0x1101124b0>
	gc: uncollectable <dict 0x110112a28>

# The test case is adapted from https://pymotw.com/2/gc/

Per https://docs.python.org/2/library/gc.html, "Objects that have __del__()
methods and are part of a reference cycle cause the entire reference cycle
to be uncollectable, including objects not necessarily in the cycle but
reachable only from it. Python doesn't collect such cycles automatically
because, in general, it isn't possible for Python to guess a safe order in
which to run the __del__() methods."
