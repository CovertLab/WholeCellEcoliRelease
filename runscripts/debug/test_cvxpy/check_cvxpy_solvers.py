'''
Test non-deterministic behavior between local and sherlock parca outputs.
Includes necessary pieces to reproduce from fitPromoterBoundProbability
function from fit_sim_data_1.py.

Results for solver options:
  GLPK (original method): differences locally and in docker vs sherlock but gives 1.0 and 0.0 when expected
  ECOS: gives comparable results and is faster (6-20x) but floating point issues for 0 and 1
  SCS: gives comparable results and is faster (1-3x) but has floating point issues for 0 and 1
  OSQP: gives different results and has floating point issues for 0 and 1 but is faster
